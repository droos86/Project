##### Summary

Mood is a CS50 final project inspired by existing health and mental wellness apps. It is designed and developed by Daniel Roos from Germany mainly using Xcode, SwiftUI, SQLite for data management, and SwiftCharts for data visualization.

Mood has three main features:
1. Users can log how they felt overall from very pleasant to very unpleasant on a daily basis with an intuitive slider.
2. Users can track their mood over time by weeks, months, and years to understand your progress.
3. User can use analytics-based insights and recommendations to improve their mood over time. (this feature will come in the next version of my app)

The app has 5 main views and a separate file to manage everything related to the SQL database.

Detailed descriptions of the views and the DatabaseManager file follow below.
